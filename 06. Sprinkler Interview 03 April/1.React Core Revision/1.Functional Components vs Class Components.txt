1. What is the difference between functional and class components?

2. Why did React move towards functional components?

3. Can we use hooks inside class components?
answer=> No we can't



functional components => are the mordern aproach for making components , functional components are nothing just a Simple javaScript function that returns JSX .
it does not have its own state or lifecycle methods but for state management they use Hooks like useState , useEffect

example => 
const Greeting = ({ name }) => HEllo, {name}! </h1>;

class components => is a javaScript class that extends React.component . it can manage its own state and use lifecycle methods ike components DidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWilUnmount

class GreetingClass extends React.component {
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
    }
}
