 16. What is props drilling ?
 Props drilling is a technique used in React to pass props from a parent component to a child component
 through multiple levels of nesting.
    
 17. What are the disadvantages of props drilling and How we can avoid props drilling ?
 Props drilling is a technique used in React to pass props from a parent component to a child component
 through multiple levels of nesting. The disadvantages of props drilling are that it can make the code
 harder to read and maintain, and it can also make it harder to debug. To avoid props
 drilling, we can use the Context API or Redux.


 18. What are Pure components in React ?
 Pure components are a type of React component that are used to optimize the performance of a React application.

 Refs are used to access DOM nodes or React elements in a component. They are used to access
 the DOM node of a component, or to access a React element in a component.

 20. What is meant by forward ref ?
 Forward ref is a technique used in React to forward a ref from a parent component to a child component
 through a function component. It is used to access the DOM node of a child component from a parent
 component.

 21. What are Error boundaries ?
 Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, like in event handlers or constructor, log them, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error
 boundaries are used to catch and handle errors in a React application.


 22. What are Higher order components in react ?
 Higher order components are a technique used in React to wrap a component with another component
 to add additional functionality to the component. They are used to add additional functionality to a component,
 like authentication or authorization.

 23. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components ?
 Controlled components are components where the state is managed by the component itself, while uncontrolled components are components
 where the state is managed by the DOM. Controlled components are used when the state needs to be
 managed by the component, while uncontrolled components are used when the state needs to be managed by th
 e DOM.

 24. What is useCallback ?
 useCallback is a hook in React that is used to memoize a function so that the function is not
 recreated on every render. It is used to optimize the performance of a React application.

 25. What are the differences between useMemo and useCallback ?
 useMemo and useCallback are both hooks in React that are used to memoize values or functions.
 useMemo is used to memoize values, while useCallback is used to memoize functions.

 26. What are keys in React ?
 Keys are used to identify a component in a list of components. They are used to keep track of
 the components in a list, and to optimize the performance of a React application.

 27. What is Lazy loading in React ?
 Lazy loading is a technique used in React to load components or data only when they are needed.
 It is used to optimize the performance of a React application by reducing the amount of data that needs to
 be loaded.

 28. What is suspense in React ?
 Suspense is a feature in React that allows you to handle loading states in your application. It is
 used to display a loading state while data is being fetched or processed.

 29. What are custom hooks ?
 Custom hooks are reusable functions that use the React hooks API to provide a specific functionality.
 They are used to abstract away complex logic and make it reusable throughout an application.

 31. What are Portals in react ?
 Portals are a feature in React that allows you to render children into a DOM node that exists outsid
 of the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. They are used to render components in a different
 location in the DOM.

 42. How would you consume a RESTful JSON API in reactjs?
 Consuming a RESTful JSON API in React involves the following steps:
 - Send a GET request to the API endpoint using the Fetch API or Axios
 - Parse the response data into a JavaScript object
 - Use the data in your React component

 43.different design patterns used in react?


 44. context api vs redux
 Context API and Redux are both used for state management in React, but they serve different purposes.
 Context API is used for managing global state, while Redux is used for managing application-wide state.

 45. prop types in react(How to apply validation on props in react)
 Prop types are used to validate the props passed to a React component. You can use the prop-types
 library to add validation to your props.

 46. What are React Mixins ?
 React Mixins are a way to reuse code in React components. They are a way to share functionality
 between components without having to create a new component or a higher-order component.

 47. what are the different hooks you have used ?


 48. What are render props in react ?
 Render props is a technique in React that allows you to pass a function as a prop to a component
 and use it to render children. It is a way to share functionality between components without having to
 create a new component or a higher-order component.
    
 49. What are the different types of exports and imports ?

 50. What are the differences between create element vs clone element in react ?

 51. When to use useState and useReducer?
 useState is used when
 you need to update a single state value, while useReducer is used when you need to update multipl
 state values.

 52. What are protected routes in react ?
 Protected routes are routes that require authentication or authorization to access.

 53. What is react-router has context menu
 React Router has a context menu that allows you to access the current route and other
