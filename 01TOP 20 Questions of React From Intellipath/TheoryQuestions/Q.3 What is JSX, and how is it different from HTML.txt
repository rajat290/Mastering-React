ðŸ‘‰ What is JSX (JavaScript XML)?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension in React that allows you to write HTML inside JavaScript code.
It is not a string or HTML file, but a JavaScript code that looks like HTML.
JSX makes it easy to create React components by using HTML-like syntax mixed with JavaScript.
React converts JSX into JavaScript behind the scenes using a tool called Babel.

ðŸ‘‰ Why do we use JSX?
It allows writing HTML elements inside JavaScript.
It makes UI creation easy and readable.
It improves the development speed by combining JavaScript + HTML.
It helps React to create Virtual DOM elements quickly.

âœ… ðŸ‘‰ Example of JSX:
ðŸ”¥ Without JSX:
const element = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Hello World');
ðŸ”¥ With JSX:
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;

ðŸ‘‰ See the difference? In JSX, it looks like HTML but it's actually JavaScript! ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥

âœ… ðŸ‘‰ How is JSX different from HTML?
Feature	   JSX (JavaScript XML)	            HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
Syntax	    JSX uses JavaScript + HTML syntax.	HTML uses only HTML syntax.
JavaScript inside	In JSX, you can use JavaScript code inside {}.	In HTML, you cannot use JavaScript directly.
Class Attribute	In JSX, we use className instead of class.	In HTML, we use class for adding CSS classes.
Self Closing Tags	JSX requires self-closing tags (like <img />).	HTML does not enforce self-closing tags.
Babel Required?	Yes, JSX needs Babel to convert JSX to JavaScript.	No Babel is needed in HTML.

âœ… ðŸ‘‰ Quick Facts about JSX:
JSX is not mandatory in React, but highly recommended because it simplifies coding.
JSX â‰  HTML, it is JavaScript that looks like HTML.
It gets converted into React.createElement() behind the scenes by Babel.
