👉 What are Props in React? (Simple Definition)

Props (short form of Properties) are read-only data that you can pass from one component to another in React.
Props allow you to make your components dynamic and reusable by passing different data.
Props are like function parameters → You pass data to a component just like you pass arguments to a function.
Props are immutable → The receiving component cannot modify the props, only the parent component can change it.

Only the parent component can modify the props and pass the updated value.
