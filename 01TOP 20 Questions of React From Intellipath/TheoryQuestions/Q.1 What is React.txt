it helps developers to create fast, dynamic and interactive user interfaces without reloading the page 

ðŸ’» Example:

When you scroll through Instagram, and without refreshing the page, you see new posts, likes, comments, etc. â€” This happens because of React.js.
Similarly, when you book a ride in Uber or Ola, and the ride status changes automatically without refreshing â€” This is also React.js.
ðŸ‘‰ React focuses only on the View Layer (UI) of an application.
ðŸ‘‰ It uses a concept called Virtual DOM to make web pages faster.
