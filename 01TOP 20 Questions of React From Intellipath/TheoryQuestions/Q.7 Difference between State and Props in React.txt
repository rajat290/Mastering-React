What is the Difference Between State and Props in React?
Both state and props are used to store and manage data in React, but they serve different purposes:


âœ… State in React:
Definition:
State is a local data structure that belongs to the component and can be changed or updated within that component.
It allows a component to track and modify data and trigger UI re-render when it changes.
Mutability:
State is mutable, meaning it can change over time, typically based on user interactions, events, or lifecycle methods.
Scope:
State is local to the component in which it is defined. It cannot be directly accessed outside the component.
Usage:
State is used for data that changes over time and is necessary for interactive features like form inputs, toggles, counters, etc.


Props in React:
Definition:
Props (short for "properties") are read-only data passed from parent to child components.
Props allow components to receive data from other components to make them dynamic and reusable.
Mutability:
Props are immutable, meaning the child component cannot modify the data received via props. Only the parent component can modify them.
Scope:
Props are global to the component where they are passed and can be accessed anywhere within the component.
Usage:
Props are used to pass data to child components or to set initial values for certain properties that a child component will use.

 ðŸ‘‰ Key Differences:
Aspect	State	Props
Mutability	State is mutable (can be changed)	Props are immutable (cannot be changed by the child)
Data Source	Managed within the component itself	Passed down from the parent component to the child
Update Mechanism	State is updated with setState() or hooks	Props cannot be updated directly by the child component
Scope	Local to the component where it's defined	Available throughout the component tree (parent to child)
Purpose	Used for interactive and dynamic data	Used for data passing and making components reusable
Re-render Trigger	State change triggers a re-render of the component	Changing props in the parent triggers a re-render in the child

âœ… ðŸ‘‰ When to Use State and When to Use Props?
Scenario	State	Props
User Input	Use state to store user input (e.g., form data, search query).	Use props to pass data from parent to child.
Dynamic Content	Use state to track changes in dynamic content (e.g., count, toggle).	Use props for static or passed data.
Rendering List of Items	Use state to manage an array of items that can change.	Use props to pass an array of items to child components.
Component Reusability	N/A (state is often specific to a component).	Use props to reuse components with different data.


 ðŸ‘‰ Key Takeaways
State: Local to the component, mutable, used for interactive data that changes over time.
Props: Passed down from parent to child components, immutable, used for passing data and making components dynamic and reusable.
