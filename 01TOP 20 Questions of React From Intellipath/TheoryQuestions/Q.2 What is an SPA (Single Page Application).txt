ðŸ‘‰ SPA (Single Page Application) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content on the page without refreshing the browser.
ðŸ‘‰ In SPA, when you navigate from one page to another (like Home â†’ About â†’ Contact), the browser does not reload â€” instead, JavaScript handles the navigation and updates the content dynamically.
ðŸ‘‰ This makes the application faster and gives a smooth user experience (like mobile apps).

ðŸ’» Example:

Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Gmail â€” all are Single Page Applications.
When you switch tabs like Home, Profile, Messages, Notifications, the page never reloads â€” instead, the content changes instantly. ðŸš€
