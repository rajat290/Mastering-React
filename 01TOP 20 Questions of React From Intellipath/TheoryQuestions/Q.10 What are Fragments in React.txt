âœ… ðŸ‘‰ What is a Fragment in React?
Fragments in React are a lightweight way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes (like <div>) to the DOM.
In React, you often return multiple elements from a component. Instead of wrapping them in a <div>, you can use Fragments to avoid adding unnecessary nodes to the DOM.
This helps in keeping the HTML cleaner and avoids unnecessary div containers.

âœ… ðŸ‘‰ Why Do We Use Fragments?
When you return multiple JSX elements from a React component, React requires them to be wrapped in a single parent element.
If you use a <div> as a wrapper, it can add unnecessary nodes to the DOM, causing unwanted nesting.
Using a Fragment (<React.Fragment> or <> </>) helps you group elements without adding an extra parent element in the DOM.

âœ… ðŸ‘‰ Why Should We Use Fragments Instead of Divs?
Aspect	Using <div>	Using <React.Fragment> or <>
DOM Structure	Adds an extra <div>	No extra element in DOM
CSS Impact	Can break CSS structure	Keeps layout clean
Performance	Slightly slower	Lightweight and fast
Readability	Less clean	Clean and readable
