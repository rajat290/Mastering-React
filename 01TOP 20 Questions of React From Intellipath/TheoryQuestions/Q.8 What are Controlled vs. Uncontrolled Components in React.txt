ðŸ‘‰ What are Controlled Components in React?
1.A controlled component is a component where React controls the form elements (input, textarea, select, etc.) through state.

2.This means the value of the input is controlled by React state and any changes to the input value are handled by event handlers (like onChange).

3.In controlled components, the input value is always in sync with state.

ðŸ‘‰ Why Are Controlled Components Used?
1.It provides full control over form elements like input fields, textareas, etc.
2.It makes it easy to validate, manipulate, and control the user input before submitting the form.
3.Recommended when you need real-time control of input value (like search input, form validation, etc.).


ðŸ‘‰ What are Uncontrolled Components in React?
An uncontrolled component is a component where React does not control the form elements.
Instead of using state, we use ref (useRef) to access the value of the input field directly from the DOM.
React is not aware of the input value changes, hence it is uncontrolled.
âœ… ðŸ‘‰ Why Are Uncontrolled Components Used?
When you don't need to control the form elements or store the value in state.
Useful for simple, non-interactive forms or when working with third-party libraries.
Provides direct access to the input element's value.


âœ… ðŸ‘‰ Key Differences Between Controlled and Uncontrolled Components:
Feature	Controlled Component	Uncontrolled Component
Control	React controls the input value via state.	React does not control the input value.
Access Value	Value is accessed via state.	Value is accessed via ref.
Use Case	Used when you need real-time control of input (like form validation).	Used when you don't need to control input or value.
React's Awareness	React is aware of input value changes.	React is not aware of input value changes.
Example	Login Form, Search Bar, Input Field	File Upload, Captcha, Third-Party Libraries
Best Practice	Recommended in most cases.	Use only when necessary.


âœ… ðŸ‘‰ When Should You Use Controlled vs Uncontrolled?
Scenario	Recommended Approach
Form Handling (Login, Registration)	âœ… Controlled Component
Real-time validation (like Email/Password)	âœ… Controlled Component
File Upload / Third-party integration	âœ… Uncontrolled Component
Minimal Control Over Input	âœ… Uncontrolled Component

âœ… ðŸ‘‰ Quick Summary:
Type	Controlled Component	Uncontrolled Component
Control Type	Controlled via state (useState)	Controlled via ref (useRef)
Access Value	state (value={state})	ref (ref.current.value)
Use Case	When you need full control over input fields.	When you just need the value once (like file upload).
Example	Form validation, dynamic input changes	File upload, third-party input fields
