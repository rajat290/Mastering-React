Destructuring is a feature in ES6 that allows you to unpack values from arrays and objects into separate variables easily and efficiently

 Why is Destructuring Used?
✅ Simplifies Code: Reduces the need for repetitive object.property or array[index] access.
✅ Improves Readability: Makes variable assignments cleaner and more structured.
✅ Extracts Only Required Values: Allows selective extraction of needed properties/values.
✅ Useful in Function Arguments: Helps pass object properties as function parameters efficiently.
