 let and const in Javascript are used to declare a varibale >>>> replacing var to improve scoping and prevent common errors.

let: Declares a variable that can be reassigned but is block-scoped.
const: Declares a constant variable that cannot be reassigned and is block-scoped.


ðŸ“Œ Why are let & const used?
Before ES6, JavaScript only had var, which had function scope and led to issues like:

Variables leaking out of loops and conditionals.
Unexpected variable overrides.
With let and const, we get: âœ… Block Scope: Variables are only accessible inside the block {} where they are defined.
âœ… Better Readability: Prevents accidental variable reassignments.
âœ… Safer Code: const ensures values don't change unintentionally.
